		<p><span class="initial-first-word">Born</span> in Jin Hua, China, Master Hong started practicing 
		Wushu with the Jin Hua Wu Shu Team when she was 8 years old. 
		She was the top Wushu athlete and Taichi champion in Zhe 
		Jiang province, China. Master Hong has a B.A. degree in

		late teenage years at University, especially after she 
		studied Chinese Medicine for two years and visited Madam 
		Chen Lixing in Xian, China Master Hong's strong belief in 
		Tai Chi's therapeutic value in life and Tai Chi's powerful 
		martial application is a constant source of inspiration for

		<h3>Student Testimonials</h3>
		
		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>CWTCA has three elements that make it a great place to study 
		and practice. Most importantly, Shifu Hong is a wonderful 
		combination of patience, knowledge and competence. Secondly, 
		we have a great connection with Chen Grandmaster Chen Zhenglai 
		who is an absolute treasure to the world taiji community. 
		Last but not least, the people who study here are really fun 
		people who I am proud to have as friends.</p>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>YiJiao Hong is an inspirational martial 
		artist and a wonderful instructor. Her students can always 
		rely on her commitment, dedication and thorough instruction. 
		The school offers diverse styles and many unique experiences 
		as well as opportunities to train with world renowned masters.</p>
		<p class="by">&mdash; Jenya Burstein</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>I wanted to learn Chen Style with one 
		of its grand masters, Chen Zhenglei. Sifu Hong helped me begin 
		learning the basic form in preparation for a seminar with 
		Master Chen. Ever since that, I have benefitted greatly from 
		Sifu and the teaching assistants. Sifu is good hearted and 
		genuinely cares about her students' progress from week to week 
		and year to year. She is constantly working on her own practice 
		and very generous in sharing her own learning from Grand Master 
		Chen with us.</p>
		 
		<p>It is fun to try to drop all my mental concerns and put my 
		mind in my body to try to really feel the movements. Taichi has 
		also helped over the years with knee pain from a long ago knee surgery.</p>
