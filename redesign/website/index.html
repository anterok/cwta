		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>I wanted to learn Chen Style with one 
		of its grand masters, Chen Zhenglei. Sifu Hong helped me begin 
		learning the basic form in preparation for a seminar with 
		Master Chen. Ever since that, I have benefitted greatly from 
		Sifu and the teaching assistants. Sifu is good hearted and 
		genuinely cares about her students' progress from week to week 
		and year to year. She is constantly working on her own practice 
		and very generous in sharing her own learning from Grand Master 
		Chen with us.</p>
		 
		<p>It is fun to try to drop all my mental concerns and put my 
		mind in my body to try to really feel the movements. Taichi has 
		also helped over the years with knee pain from a long ago knee surgery.</p>
