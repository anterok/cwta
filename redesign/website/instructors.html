	<div class="testimonial">
	<p>I was originally drawn to CWTA after learning about Master Instructor Yijiao Hong: her thorough training since childhood in China, her subsequent career as a Wushu instructor in China and &mdash; since the 1990s &mdash; in Seattle, and the international recognition accorded her. This gave me enough confidence at least to try the place out. I'm very happy I made that decision. Sifu Hong and Yang Tai Chi instructor James Guidon are welcoming and patient, and the instruction appropriate to one's experience. But it is detailed and systematic, and nicely designed to build  your practice step by step. You quickly understand that the instructors are also skilled and conscientious teachers as well as practitioners and that they really want to help you progress. The training goes on at many levels: from learning the outer forms; to learning the principles of alignment and coordination that underlie the forms; to the awareness of the sensations accompanying the physical movements; to the mental concentration that enables all of this. And the results slowly but surely become apparent: the strengthening of key muscles and the stabilization of joints; an improvement in balance and efficiency of movement; more physical and mental relaxation; and a deeper breathing that seems to permeate more of the body. And not to be overlooked: it becomes a lot of fun just to practice! I have much appreciation for this school and these teachers.</p>

	<p>I'm afraid I don't remember when I started....I think it was 05.</p>
	<p>Since 2005, in my 60th year, Sifu Yijiao Hong's Tai Chi classes have inspired me to become a committed practitioner of this martial art. I began the study for the fun of it, with virtually no inkling of the profound effects that tai chi would have on me. Soon, I began to notice that I was calmer, and more "settled." Over the years, the subtle benefits of tai chi have accumulated, and I am dramatically stronger, more agile, and healthier than I ever imagined I would be at my age (knock wood -- I take no medications besides nutritional supplements). In addition, tai chi has helped me to develop more self-confidence and a heightened ability to focus my mind on whatever I'm doing.</p> 
	<p>I'm grateful to be a student of Sifu Yijiao Hong; she is a revered teacher; one who is widely known for her ability to help students develop deep awareness of the internal work of tai chi. I encourage anyone who enjoys movement, or wishes to, and who aims to enhance overall physical, emotional, and mental well-being, to explore the practice of tai chi. </p>

	<p>CWTCALLC  has three elements that make it a great place to study and practice. Most importantly, Shifu Hong is a wonderful combination of patience, knowledge and competence. Secondly, we have a great connection with Chen Grandmaster Chen Zenglai who is an absolute treasure to the world taiji community. Last but not least, the people who study here are really fun people who I am proud to have as friends.</p>

	<p>I have been training in Yang Style Taichi for several years now.  The instructor is very thorough and very patient in explaining the form and its application.  YiJiao Hong  leads us at a pace to allow for assimilating the new movements and their meaning.  Taichi is something that can be improved continuously.  The practitioner can always get better, more concentrated, more fluid, more relaxed and focused.  The instructor helps by observing and correcting.  She continually refers back to the basics and their application.  Her goal is to help us understand so deeply that we can self-correct.  Regular practice is the key to receive the benefits of Taichi.  The Chinese Taichi and Wushu Academy is a great place to learn and to practice Taichi.  It's something I believe I will be able to do for the rest of my life.</p>

	<p>Tai chi has really helped with the arthritis I have in my knees and my feet, and I think it has helped me keep moving much better than if I had never started it.</p>

	<p>I wanted to learn Chen Style with one of its grand masters, Chen Zhenglei. Sifu Hong helped me begin learning the basic form in preparation for a seminar with Master Chen. Ever since that, I have benefitted greatly from Sifu and the teaching assistants. Sifu is good hearted and genuinely cares about her students' progress from week to week and year to year. She is constantly working on her own practice and very generous in sharing her own learning from Grand Master Chen with us.</p> 
	<p>it is fun to try to drop all my mental concerns and put my mind in my body to try to really feel the movements. Tai Chi has also helped over the years with knee pain from a long ago knee surgery.</p>

	<p>It is very fun to have my teacher who has experienced the positive impacts tai chi can have on one's happiness and health.

	<p>After many years of participating in all types of sports,  including  5 years of Kung Fu. I was looking for a form of exercise that I could learn and practice for the rest of my life.
 
	Chen Style Tai Chi is my answer to that quest. It offers a rich history,  physically  challenging forms , a never ending source of  learning on how the forms relate to my ever changing body. Exercising my body and mind are essential to my longevity and well being.  I have Asthma and practicing Tai Chi allows me to continue practicing through my episodes , while calming  and deepening my breathing. The fact that Chen Style Tai Chi is practiced by millions of people of all ages around the world only reinforces  that  I have made the right decision to follow this path of discovery.
